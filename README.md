This tutorial consists of three parts:

### 1. Sequencing and basecalling

Includes tutorials for data management and transfer from the MinION after completion of a sequencing run, and super high accuracy basecalling using Dorado.

### 2. Quality control for whole genome sequencing output

### 3. Quality control for amplicon sequencing output
